👋 Hi, I’m @AmaarIbrahim
🛠️ I’m building a PHP-based event planner with email notifications.
📅 This project allows users to schedule events and receive reminders via email.
📧 Uses PHPMailer to send event details as .ics attachments.

🚀 Features:
✅ Add, view, and delete events.
✅ Send event notifications via email.
✅ Supports different event types: Appointments, Tasks, and Reminders.
✅ Simple and clean UI with Bootstrap.

🔧 Technologies:
- PHP & MySQL
- PHPMailer ([PHPMailer GitHub](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer))
- Bootstrap

🔑 Note: You need an app password to send emails via PHPMailer. For Gmail users, enable "Less Secure Apps" or generate an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) in your Google account settings.
